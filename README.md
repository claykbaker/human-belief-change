# human_belief_change

This repository contains files related to the human belief change research project, undertaken by Clayton K. Baker (Master's student at the time of writing at the University of Cape Town and CAIR) and Tommie Meyer (Professor of Computer Science at the University of Cape Town and CAIR).

For each experiment (there are 4 total), we use the following folder structure:
> data collection (raw data)

> data cleaning (data cleaning codebooks/scripts)

> data analysis (data analysis codebooks, calculations and graphs)

Additionally, where R was used to program the data cleaning step, we provide the .rproj file. The .rproj file is an application that runs on RStudio. The requirement for execution is that you have downloaded RStudio and the subfolders contained in the data cleaning folder.

While the raw data is made available, care has been taken to remove participants' personal identifiers (MTurk Worker ID). It may be the case that the raw data contains duplicate responses or incomplete responses. This has been accounted for in the data cleaning step such that our final codebooks and cleaned data contain only unique, complete responses.
