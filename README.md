# human_belief_change

This repository contains files related to the human belief change research project, undertaken by Clayton K. Baker (Master's student at the time of writing at the University of Cape Town and CAIR) and Prof Tommie Meyer (Professor of Computer Science at the University of Cape Town and CAIR).

Each experiment (there are 4 total) has its own folder and associated files:
> data collection

> data cleaning

> data analysis

For each experiment, you will find raw data (.csv), cleaned data (.csv), codebooks (.xlxs), and analysis spreadsheets (.xlxs). 

Additionally, where R was used to program the data cleaning step, we provide the .rproj file. The .rproj file is an application that runs on RStudio written in the R programming language. The requirement for execution is that RStudio has access to the data cleaning folder and its subfolders which contain the program scripts, data input, data output and figure output.

While the raw data is made available, care has been taken to remove participants' personal identifiers (MTurk Worker ID). It may be the case that the raw data contains duplicate responses or incomplete responses. This has been accounted for in the data cleaning step such that our final codebooks and cleaned data contain unique, complete responses.
